      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    pandas - a powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python\n",
      "    =====================================================================\n",
      "    \n",
      "    **pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data\n",
      "    structures designed to make working with \"relational\" or \"labeled\" data both\n",
      "    easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\n",
      "    doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\n",
      "    the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\n",
      "    analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\n",
      "    its way toward this goal.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Main Features\n",
      "    -------------\n",
      "    Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n",
      "    \n",
      "      - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating\n",
      "        point data.\n",
      "      - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and\n",
      "        higher dimensional objects\n",
      "      - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned\n",
      "        to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let\n",
      "        `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n",
      "        computations.\n",
      "      - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine\n",
      "        operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data.\n",
      "      - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python\n",
      "        and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects.\n",
      "      - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large\n",
      "        data sets.\n",
      "      - Intuitive merging and joining data sets.\n",
      "      - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n",
      "      - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick).\n",
      "      - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),\n",
      "        Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5\n",
      "        format.\n",
      "      - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency\n",
      "        conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions,\n",
      "        date shifting and lagging, etc.\n",
